# SEC-TOOLS

Scripts to install some useful Security Assessment and Pentesting tools in Fedora Linux.
This isn't meant to replace full security distributions or Spins such as Kali Linux, Parrot or the like. Simply to make installing some necessary tools onto Fedora Linux easier so I didn't have to keep doing it every time I built a new VM.

## Instructions

Clone the repo and run from Bash.
Should be run as a regular user with sudo privileges. Ideally you should have NOPASSWD with sudo for a non-interactive installation.
